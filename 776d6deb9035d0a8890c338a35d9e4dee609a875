(https://ci.trustedfirmware.org/job/tf-a-lts2.8-ci-gateway/4297/)\n\nAssumed at the beginning, it\u0027s because the juno board is OFFLINE as we have seen few cases recently. But a little suspicious because the same test PASSED on lts-v2.10 run as also the rest of the juno tests PASSED in lts-v2.8. This one case FAIL even on re-run. It might be worth looking into this.\n\n\"\n18:56:51 id          : 2394451\n18:56:51 description : tf-juno\n18:56:51 submitter   : ****\n18:56:51 device-type : juno\n18:56:51 device      : None\n18:56:51 health-check: False\n18:56:51 state       : Submitted\n18:56:51 Health      : Unknown\n18:56:51 pipeline    : True\n18:56:51 tags        : [\u0027juno-r1\u0027]\n18:56:51 visibility  : Public\n\"",
