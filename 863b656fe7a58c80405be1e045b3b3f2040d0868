      "message": "The patches fix different things:\n\n* The first patch (https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/tf-a-tests/+/38962) fixes the macros for the register OPCODEs, as the field offsets used there correspond to the offsets as used by the ESR_EL2 register when trapping accesses, not the offsets used on the encodings for MSR/MRS instructions as expected.\n* This patch, along with other things, adds an offset to the values calculated by the previous one so that the register opcodes match the ones used by KVM (which start at offset 0 rather than 5 as on MRS/MSR instructions).\n\nNow, both patches are separated because when I implemented this on RMM, first I fixed one thing and I wrote the counter patch on TFTF and then I moved to the next patch and did the same. Then I was going to squash the patches together (here and on RMM) but decided to leave them as-is for review purposes, as it would be easy to squash them later if we decided so.\n\nSo I can squash this patch and the previous one together and the same with the counterparts on RMM.",
