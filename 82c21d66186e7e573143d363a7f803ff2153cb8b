Ideally this header would be the same in both repositories, and we aren\u0027t even using the defines here, so I don\u0027t see why we should make them diverge. Regarding SMCCCv1 and SMCCCv2, I guess we have to fix it in this repository.",

      "message": "I am proposing this change because I think it is confusing to name these macros *_START/END when in fact they have the same value. If one looks at the SMC calling convention specification, one can clearly see in table 2-1 that there is a single owning entity number for most of the service calls. Only the calls related to the Trusted OS and Trusted applications cover a range. In my mind, this is the exception rather than the general rule.\n\nI believe TF-A introduced this convention because it fit well in the context of the DECLARE_RT_SVC() macro, which allows to attach an SMC handler for a range of SMCs.  This is not relevant in the context of TF-A Tests and I don\u0027t see any value in doing that.\n\nI don\u0027t think we should necessarily aim at sharing this header file between TF-A and TF-A Tests. The SMCCC specification doesn\u0027t get updated that often so I think it is reasonable to edit both the TF-A and TF-A Tests versions of these definitions whenever there is a new version.\n\n \u003e we aren\u0027t even using the defines here, so I don\u0027t see why we should make them diverge.\n\nI am currently preparing a patch that will use them.\n\n\u003e Regarding SMCCCv1 and SMCCCv2, I guess we have to fix it in this repository.\n\nYes, we do but I believe this can be done in another patch.",

      "message": "Why not sharing this file as well? As far as I see, there is nothing TF-specific or TFTF-specific here. Sure, this file doesn\u0027t change a lot, but I still think that sharing the files makes more sense. This file is included by other ones that have defines for services (like SPCI and SPRT), so I\u0027d rather know that the file is always going to be the same on both sides (or that updating it is going to be trivial).",

      "message": "\u003e As far as I see, there is nothing TF-specific or TFTF-specific here.\n\nAs I\u0027ve said, I think that enforcing the *_START/END naming convention for all OENs *is* TF-specific, as it is tied to the way of declaring a runtime service in TF. In other words, I think it is a bit odd to do it already in TF-A but there is a good reason for it behind it, which we don\u0027t have in TF-A Tests.",
