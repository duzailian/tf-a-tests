      "message": "Hi Raghu\nI see that this macro is essentially a data cache operation on the virtual addresses in the range target_addr to target_addr+cpy_range. The addresses for the subsequent reads are also computed from target_addr. I was under the impression that this is a true dependency and the execution would essentially follow \"sequential consistency\" model. Hence, I did not use an explicit barrier such as DSB. Let me know your thoughts.\n\nfortunately, the macro has an implicit barrier: https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/tf-a-tests.git/tree/lib/aarch64/cache_helpers.S#n34",
