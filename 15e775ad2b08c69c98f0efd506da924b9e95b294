      "message": "Originally, any access from R-EL2 to MPAM registers was trapped into EL3. The patch on TF-A prevents this, so now RMM can access and configure MPAM.\n\nAs RMM hides MPAM to realms (EL1/0), we want that any access from a realm to its registers be trapped by RMM, which in turn will inject an undef abort back to the realm.\n\nThis test tests that, effectively, if a realm tries to access an MPAM register, RMM injects an undef abort to it",
