      "message": "Any callers using tftf_smc() will have SVE hint bit set in SMC FID if the CPU supports SVE and SVE traps are enabled in trap register (cptr_el2 for EL2 payload and cpacr_el1 for EL1 payload).\n\nThis change breaks four world testing, on SVE enabled config. Cactus SP runs with cpacr_el1.zen\u003d0, and some code path in Cactus uses tftf_smc, and this set SVE hint bit. The ffa_handler() in Hafnium currently doesn\u0027t discard SVE hint bit in SMC FID as part of the function identification and this causes the boot to fail.\n\nThis needs investigation if tftf_smc used in Cactus can be replaced with ffa_smc or ffa_service_call.",
