      "message": "Do these functions need to be implemented in assembly? Can\u0027t they be in C instead?\n\nAFAICS, console_init() is called from tftf_early_platform_setup() and at this time we\u0027ve already got a stack set up (although it is the temporary one). For secure partitions, it\u0027s even called later, in their main function.",

      "message": "Same as the comment below. I think that, because this could be used as skeleton for new consoles, it is better to have it in assembly. I can imagine some people will simply copy code from TF into this repository and this way it is easier for them to do it.",

      "message": "Are you saying that there is no technical reason for implementing this console driver in C from the point of view of TF-A Tests (i.e. that these are indeed called after the stack has been setup), but in the case of TF-A this console driver is used much earlier (i.e. before the stacks are setup) so it is required to implement them in assembly language there?",
