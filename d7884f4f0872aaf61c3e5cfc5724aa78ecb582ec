      "message": "I understand that there is no PVM in hafnium in S-EL2. Also agree there is HCR_EL2 but SCR_EL3 takes priority over HCR_EL2 settings and the interrupts will trap to EL3 if the SCR_EL3.FIQ/IRQ is set.\nIs there going to be an accompanying change in SPMD that changes the routing model to enable interrupts to trap to EL3?\n\nMy question comes from the wording in the commit message, which says that interrupts trap to S-EL2. Strictly, that may not be the case due to SCR_EL3 settings, so maybe it may need to be worded to say that interrupts trap to EL3 or S-EL2 and then injected into the SP.",
