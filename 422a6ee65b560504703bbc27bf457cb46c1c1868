      "message": "Not sure that\u0027s the right trigger.... S-EL2 may be implemented in HW, but no component loaded at this exception layer (aka v8.4 hw without sw support for secure virtualization).\nMoreover, this leads to the debate: is a VM (or SP) meant to be aware that it runs in a virtual machine? Adding those conditional code makes it harder for the code to scale (e.g. use the same service code from an SP directly into a VM).",
