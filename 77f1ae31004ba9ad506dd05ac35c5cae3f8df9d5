      "message": "TCR_EL2 and TCR_EL3 are both 64-bit registers so it seems weird to me to use ULL literal constants for the former and UL for the latter.\n\nNow, looking at these registers definitions in the Arm ARM, I suppose the reason is, TCR_EL3[63:32] are always 0 so the register can be safely truncated to 32-bits, whereas TCR_EL2[63:32] bits might be different from 0 (depending on the value of the HCR_EL2.E2H bit).\n\nStill, even if it might be safe for now, this seems like too much built-in assumption to me. What if a future version of the Arm architecture uses some of the 32 most significant bits of TCR_EL3?\n\nI think it might be better to use ULL literal constants for both registers, unless there\u0027s a good reason not to do so.",
