In which case, could we instead add the latter testsuite in the standard test suite? Or does this need to be kept separate? If yes, why?\n\nIf we need to keep things this way, then can I suggest we choose a different test suite name? tests-validate does not make much sense to me. Perhaps tests-all?",
