      "message": "The intent in spliting is to make it so if you set HEAD to which ever commit in the patch stack, the project will build, and it is still executable (i.e. the tests can still invoked without failures).\n\nThat being said, and because I think it is good to split cactus patches from tftf, to make it easy to review:\n- cactus change needs to be merged before tftf, otherwise tests would fail settig HEAD to tftf patches.\n- the FF-A call wrappers are needed in cactus and tftf, so they need to be there before cactus patches otherwise there are compilation errors if setting HEAD to cactus.",

      "message": "Ok, this makes sense, I definitely agree all commits need to be able to build and be executable. I think since the cactus functions are called from the tftf tests it would probably be ok to have them in the same commit, however I understand if you want to keep them separate. I do however think that the commit tittles need changing as they are currently either the same or very similar for the patches that define the wrapper to the ones that use it and introduce the tests.",

      "message": "Prefer to keep the cactus patches separate, as they might be used in multiple tests in TFTF, not necessarily just those testing a given ABI.\nAlso for the sake of having a more manageable size of changes. Helps to get reviews done.\n\nAddressed though, your comment about changing the commit titles. Have a look and let me know.",
