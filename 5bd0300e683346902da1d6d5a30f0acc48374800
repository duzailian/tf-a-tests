      "message": "The code per se looks fine to me but I wonder whether this is the right place in the directory layout. Would tftf/tests/runtime_services/secure_service/ not be a better fit?\n\nAlso, I think the file itself might be misnamed. It is indeed one of the building blocks to test TTST in the bigger picture but if one just have a look at what the code in this file does, there is nothing specific to TTST there so this sounds confusing to me.",
