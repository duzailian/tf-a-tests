      "message": "The CI complained about the order of these #include directives not following the guidelines here: https://trustedfirmware-a.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process/coding-style.html#include-statement-ordering\n\nArguably these are TF-A coding style rules, not TF-A Tests ones but we implicitly follow the same rules (with the same set of CI scripts checking them). We should update the TF-A Tests doc to make that explicit...\n\nWould you mind re-organizing these header files into system/project/platform groups, as described in the TF-A doc linked above?",
