      "message": "In existing build flow cactus.dts is from its source path. Now The .dts files are copied\nto build directory for below reasons.\n1. when BUILD_PLAT is set (like fvp_debug), the old way to find cactus.dts breaks as the\n   path is relative (the pattern \"../../../\" in sp_layout file is not valid)\n\n2. To support multiple platform. As with more than one platform sp_layout file will refer\n   to cactus.dts from its plat build dir. Instead of referring to spm/cactus/cactus.dts\n\n3. to remove dependencies to source directory. yocto build framework removes the source dir\n   after build. So when sp_layout file is passed to tf-a build, it won\u0027t find .dts as there are\n   references to source code dir.\n\nI have added a brief note in commit message. Please let me know if commit msg needs update.",
