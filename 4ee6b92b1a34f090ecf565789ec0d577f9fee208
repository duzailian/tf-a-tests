Other endpoints can\u0027t send another cactus command and obtain a response because its execution hasn\u0027t reached the message loop.\nSo the test SP\u0027s implementation doesn\u0027t fit one for the ME enabled configuration.\n\nI understand though that the caller to SP sleep command needs to get the \"elapsed time\". For this, we could add another cactus command: \"last_elapsed_time_cmd\". something like this...\nIt could check if the sender of such request was the last endpoint to call the sleep_cmd, if so provide read and provide the lapsed time; If not, return error.\n\nWith this the sleep_cmd could be changed: to save the id of the most recent caller to this command; and to look for a \"ME\" flag, to be set in the IRQ handler.\nIf the \"ME\" flag is set, do an ME dir response; else return with elapsed time.\n\nAfter doing those changes the tests for ME in TFTF should be:\n- Calling the Sleep Cmd;\n- Expect the ME response;\n- (Optional, although useful validation) Get other SPs to do a direct message request to validate others can communicate with the SP (request echo command was implemented);\n- Send the \"last_elapsed_time\" command, and check if the time was as expected.\n\nLet me know what you think of these suggestions.",

      "message": "You made a very interesting point. I appreciate that once SP goes into waiting state, it should be able to handle new requests from any endpoint. This is infact why a SP with ME is leveraged in some scenarios.\n\nHowever, I believe there is an important caveat. The above feature is applicable only when an execution context has more than one application thread. When a NS interrupt fires, the running application thread gets preempted and the SP goes to waiting state. It is able to take on new requests since it has other application threads that are still running.\n\nAs you already know, Cactus SP vCPU does not implement application threads. So , in practice, it is equivalent to having a single application thread; which in our scenario got preempted. This is the reason why I think we cannot implement above suggestions.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts. I would love to discuss with you more.",
