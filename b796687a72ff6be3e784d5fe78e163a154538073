I don\u0027t see any TF-A patch from you in review to go with this change in TF-A tests so I am assuming this is targeting existing TF-A source code, which has PSCI_MAX_PWR_LVL defined to 3? [1]\n\nWhat was the consequence of having TF-A tests using less power levels than TF-A? Was it simply that it could not exercise all the power levels which TF-A supported?\n\n[1] https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/tree/include/lib/psci/psci.h#n38",
