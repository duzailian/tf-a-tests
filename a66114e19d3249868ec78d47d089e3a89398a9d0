Each test execute from boot to test. Whereas here all tests are executed in a bulk.\n\nWill have in mind how this could be done, even if not immediately as a future improvement.",

      "message": "the whole test looks actually quite similar to the above.\nWould it be worth having a \"base test function\" that receives the expected action for the target SP, and validate accordingly? Essentially between tests there is a difference in the middle section with use-case specific validation. For example in the ME test there is a validation to the Managed Exit response.\n\nNot a huge deal considering this test code, however could help with reducing code to be maintained as the project goes forward. In doing this, the helper function that I suggested below, becomes a bit redundant I guess...",
