      "message": "I was quite surprised this is the case. But there is a slight drawback to this - the accessors are write_wfit(). As this seems like it will be a recurring issue - d128 comes to mind, but i\u0027m looking at a couple more, wouldn\u0027t it be better to do more generically with a macro that produces something like\n`__asm__ (\"sys \" #_op1 \", \" #_CRn \", \" #_CRm \", \" #_op2 \", %0\": : \"r\" (v));`\n\nThe only drawback is that this doesn\u0027t play well with our `S0_3_C1_C0_1` literals so far though. But it will be reusable and does away with the write artefact.",
