The complete list corresponds to this Gerrit group: https://review.trustedfirmware.org/admin/groups/4,members\n\nI wonder whether we should just provide this link here.

One question that I have is whether we need the info to be completely open or not. It\u0027s not possible to view that list without having a github account - that may or may not be an issue.",
