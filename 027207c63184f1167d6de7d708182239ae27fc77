      "message": "Having a closer look at TRNDR, it should connect the SCR_TRNDR_BIT to FEAT_RNG, not FEAT_RNG_TRAP. That would match the SMCCC spec saying that the bit set means access to the registers mentioned in the ARM ARM is working, and those registers are RNDR and RNDRRS. I will fix that.",
