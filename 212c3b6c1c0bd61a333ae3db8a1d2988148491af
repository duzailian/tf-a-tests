      "message": "Not necessarily. \n\nThis cmd aims at creating a scenario where we have a cyclic dependency such: A-\u003eB-\u003eC-\u003eA\nAnd validate this is not possible.\n\nThe need for command comes from:\n- we trigger tests from NWd (when cmd is CACTUS_REQ_DEADLOCK_CMD);\n- SPs can\u0027t communicate back to NWd other than with a response;\n\nSo the loop of dependencies is to be created between SPs. Therefore the whole sequence of communication is:\nNWd -\u003e A-\u003eB-\u003eC-\u003eD\n\nSo that argument is only relevant on the first time this handler is executed. At this point there is not really a Previous next.\n\nSteps to create cycle with CACTUS_REQ_DEADLOCK_CMD:\n- NWd sends request to A:\n - receiver A\n - Next B\n - Next2 C\n\nAfter this point SPs will create a cyclic dependency between them using CACTUS_DEADLOCK_CMD, at this point we could consider a \"previous next\" however, no need because we can just reuse the arguments in the payload. right?",
