      "message": "The idea, at least as far as I understand it, is that we are checking (while not being in EL3) whether the context management library has done its work correctly. This is why the Expected and Actual contexts should match - because the library is supposed to save the non-secure context for it to then be fully restored back after executing secure-state code.",
