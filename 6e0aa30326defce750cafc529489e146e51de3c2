      "message": "LGTM.\nIn my understanding, altogether 2 issues resolved here:\n\n* Skipping the tests rather than passing as its tough to identify b/w \n  undef_injection and other EL2 TRAPS as both return same error. So its better to \n  skip, when hardware doesn\u0027t support feature.\n\n* Test should be validating software than hardware. So when the ID register \n  indicate \"no\" skipping the test is the best option.\n\n* Splitting the test for better maintenance of the overall test_suite. It also \n  gives better clarity on which feature test was skipped/passed/failed.\n\n@Arvind / @Manish P, kindly have a look and share your thoughts.",
