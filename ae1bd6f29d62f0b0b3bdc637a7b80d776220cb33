      "message": "Not sure thats possible. The test uses spm_run_multi_core_test which does a CPU on before running the function on a particular core.\nSo it looks like host_realm_spm.c attempts to enable the watchdog timer. in host_realm_sec_interrupt_can_preempt_rl it seems like we are using the watchdog timer and cactus has configured the MPIDR to target a CPU that is off. I think we have to update that test to run on the different core.\nIs that acceptable to you ?",
