      "message": "Not sure thats possible. The test uses spm_run_multi_core_test which does a CPU on before running the function on a particular core.\nSo it looks like host_realm_spm.c attempts to enable the watchdog timer. in host_realm_sec_interrupt_can_preempt_rl it seems like we are using the watchdog timer and cactus has configured the MPIDR to target a CPU that is off. I think we have to update that test to run on the different core.\nIs that acceptable to you ?",

      "message": "Somehow the secure interrupt routing has changed with this test. Now whether this test restores the original routing after its done or the RME test should ensure the interrupt target is set correctly before the test, I dont have an opinion. It depends on the SPM feature and how it is meant to be used. Will leave this upto the Hafnium team to take this forward.",
