      "message": "Hi Olivier, this patch looks great actually and simpler than the patch stack i had. The only disadvantage i see with this is we cannot reuse a lot of the cactus infra put into place. Almost all the tests that work on S-EL1 VMs should work on S-EL0 with minor mods so if we go this route, we have to replicate or reuse the cactus infra in place as much as possible for ivy testing...I\u0027m happy to contribute adding EL0 tests for direct messaging etc if we can have this merged...\nI have no strong preference for one approach over the other. From a code cleanliness point of view, i think this is a clear winner.",
