      "message": "No that\u0027s not the same.\nspmc_id refers to the FF-A ID of the entity running at secure physical FF-A instance e.g. Hafnium or cactus_spmc. It\u0027s meant to be configurable in the platform spmc manifest (or hardcoded in Tegra\u0027s case: plat/nvidia/tegra/common/plat_spmd_manifest.c). In our usages we fix it to 0x8000 but obviously it could theoretically be another value. If can be requested by the SPMC to the SPMD using FFA_ID_GET.\nA VM or SP FF-A id only exists when virtualization is enabled (aka S-EL2 / Hafnium is present), and is the id value of the SP at secure virtual FF-A instance. It can be requested from the SP and returned to the SPMC through FFA_ID_GET. It has no rationale/meaning in the cactus_spmc case because virtual machines do not exist. In Hafnium/SPMC case, SP FF-A ids are counted from 0x8001 to 0xFFFE.\nGenerally, an FF-A component SPMC / VM / SP shall get its FF-A ID using FFA_ID_GET and not assume its own ID statically in the code.",
