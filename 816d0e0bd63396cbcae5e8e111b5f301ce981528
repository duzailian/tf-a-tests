Now it makes sense to me.\nWhen you mentioned line 26 as well as at 71, I was confused.\n\nI think, at line number 53, we first verified ABI is present or not and then testing the fucntions/features.\nIn a way when we call tftf_trng_version(), we are indirectly checking line number 53. Its kind of redundant check not a harm though. \nIf required that could be taken out. Please do let me know your thoughts here.",
