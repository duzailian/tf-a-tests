I have considered all commits merged till 25th May.\nWill push a new patch for the latest commits.\n\nRegarding Makefile change, I don\u0027t have a strong opinion to push it as separate or with this patch. Looking at the 2.6 release, we have pushed it separately. https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/tf-a-tests.git/commit/?id\u003d8f20d8da7da5ffcc07c6046244b0baadb7aeffd3\n\nBut even I agree with your suggestion to include it as part of this change, similar to TF-A. \n\nFor now, I will update the makefile as part of this change and wait for others\u0027 comments.",
