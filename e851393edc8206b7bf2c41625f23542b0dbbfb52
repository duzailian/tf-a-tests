      "message": "Removing the weak implementation of platform_get_core_pos() makes sense to me because I think its implementation varies too much from one platform port to another.\n\nBut does it make sense for the console functions? I would have assumed that the weak implementations in this file would be quite invariant. We might want to use some PLAT_UART_BASE macro instead of the Arm-specific version but perhaps that\u0027s all we need to make it more generic.\n\nThese weak functions call the console_core_init/putc/flush() functions, which are currently implemented only by the PL011 driver and obviously not all platforms use a PL011 UART so I guess that\u0027s your argument for moving them to the platform layer.\n\nBut console_core_init/putc/flush() seem like generic UART callbacks that any UART driver could potentially implement. In this context, I think this makes these weak functions a sane, default implementation.",
