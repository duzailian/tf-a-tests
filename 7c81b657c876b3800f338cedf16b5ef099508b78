      "message": "Well, you tell me, but I saw quite some IS_IN_EL2() checks protecting EL2 system registers, so I assumed that we could run in EL1. For FVP or Arm Ltd. platforms running in EL2 is surely normal, but other platforms might not be so generous. So I figured that it doesn\u0027t take much to also test EL1 or deal with EL2 not being available. So I don\u0027t see the \"overkill\" aspect.\nAlso keep in mind that writing to EL1 sysregs is also to make sure they don\u0027t get corrupted as well over the smc, hence I used a different pattern.",
