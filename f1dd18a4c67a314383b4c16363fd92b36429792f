In line 236 of the test source file, tftf is donating a memory segment named \"consecutive_donate_page\" and in the next step(line 245), it is donating a different memory segment(named \"share_page\").\n\nPerhaps, I might have misunderstood the test.",

      "message": "Ah, good catch.\nThe idea of usint consecutive_donate_page was to decouple from the tests using share_page. The last test using share_page was doing a donate. so effectively from line 245 there was the same test in question.\nSomething may have happened whilst I was changing few things.\nChanged it to be always consecutive_donate_page.",
