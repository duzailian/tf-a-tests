      "message": "I think testing the el1 registers is redundant. EL3 only has a single control so touching a single register is sufficient to test them all. Similar to FEAT_THE below, we don\u0027t trap the access but we should make sure they are context switched correctly",

      "message": "this will always use the 64-bit accessors, no? It should choose the correct one. \n\nI\u0027m not 100% sure that testing it here for 64-bits and with FEAT_D128 for 128 bits is the best approach. If it all lives here, then it\u0027s a bit less code and easier to follow IMO",
