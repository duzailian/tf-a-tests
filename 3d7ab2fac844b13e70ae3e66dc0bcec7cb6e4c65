      "message": "Just sharing my understanding to avoid confusion and get others\u0027 opinions as well. \n\nAs per the spec, we need to set the SMCR_Elx with the max value (0x1ff) to figure out the supported Effective streaming SVL at a given ELx.\nSo we have SME_SMCR_LEN_MAX (0x1ff) in sme. h.\n\nOnce we write this into the SMCR_ELx register, we could calculate the overall supported Streaming SVL count.\nAfter this, we write into the SMCR_Elx.LEN field( iteratively from 0 to count value), we calculated from the previous step to evaluate the SVL value for each iteration.\nSo in a way, SMCR_ELX_LEN_MASK should be (0xf) precisely, as the LEN field is 4 bits, even though setting  SMCR_Elx_LEN_MASK \u003d(0x1ff), had not harmed it.\nSo I agree with this change.",
