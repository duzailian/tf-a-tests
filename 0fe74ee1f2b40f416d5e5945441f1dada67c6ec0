      "message": "Well, the test is fine, and the TF-A code is fine, so I think it\u0027s not something for the CI to moan about. It\u0027s just that new SPE versions *could* introduce something new that needs test coverage, but we should encounter this anyway during a new arch revision review process.\nI just added this patch since for me it broke the whole test run, even though there was nothing wrong. That\u0027s why I think a warning in the CI output should be enough, since it won\u0027t spoil other tests.",
