      "message": "understood. I was wondering if it should even be a panic. These conditions should never occur and those are(invariants) and typically what you would assert on...But since this is a test app i guess a panic might be okay..If asserts are compiled in always for cactus, it would seem cleaner to see asserts in code or perhaps these should be a macro like hafnium\u0027s EXPECT_EQ.\nAnyway, not strongly opposed. Just general curiosity. This is totally fine.",
