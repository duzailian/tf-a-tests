      "message": "Acknowledged. This change was required as the next patch (sve hint support) maintains a per cpu array:\nstatic bool smc_sve_hint[PLATFORM_CORE_COUNT];\n\nAs PLATFORM_CORE_COUNT core count macro is not applicable to Realm payloads, we need to find another way to keep track of SVE hint bit. As you have suggested we can use CPTR_EL2.TZ flags or CPACR.ZEN flags to denote the presence of SVE. I will move SVE hint bit support patch to the top of this stack and re-work on it.",
