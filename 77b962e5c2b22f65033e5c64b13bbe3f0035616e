      "message": "Perhaps explain why these macros are copied in the DTS file rather than including the relevant header file like we do with cactus_def.h. I believe the reason is that including the FVP platform header file would pull in too many definitions from a long chain of dependent header files, is that right?",

This is something that we need to fix, so I\u0027ve added a note. It\u0027s a bit tricky as a reasonably big chunk of the dts is platform-specific.",
