      "message": "(minor) I know all strings are 28 bytes so it does not matter whether we take the size of the 1st one or the 2nd one. Still, that stroke me at first, I expected sizeof(expect_str[0]) then sizeof(expect_str[1]) and so on, it looked off to me. Don\u0027t you think it would be better to increase the index at each line?",
