      "message": "why do you need a ret? This is a macro, so cannot be called from C files and if it is to be used in assembly, it can only be used at the end of a function. Seems like it is coded to be used only in the amu file... might want to leave out the ret here and keep the ret instruction in the amu assembly.",
