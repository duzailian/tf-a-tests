      "message": "why do you need a ret? This is a macro, so cannot be called from C files and if it is to be used in assembly, it can only be used at the end of a function. Seems like it is coded to be used only in the amu file... might want to leave out the ret here and keep the ret instruction in the amu assembly.",

      "message": "\"this is MACRO which defines a FUCNTION\" - The statement itself is confusing. Would you consider func read reg:req instead? It is confusing to a reader(at least me) if it is a macro and ends with a ret. If it is a func, it\u0027ll be clear that this can be called using a branch instruction. The macro seems not useful anywhere else except in the amu_helper.S the way it is written and your links suggest that too. This can be a generic macro/func that can be used in other places too if the ret is removed.\n\nMoreover, i question the usefulness of the bti instruction in this case. This is a perfect gadget to read system registers for ROP/JOP attacks by the very fact that bti has been added followed by one instruction followed by a ret. I wonder if the same function from amu_helpers.S was written in C, what code the compiler would generate. If it ends up spraying a bunch of BTI\u0027s like we are doing here, then i guess it is okay.",

It defines a name that you can use as a convenient alternative to repeating the block of code.\nThe main uses for a macro are:\n    To make it easier to follow the logic of the source code by replacing a block of code with a single meaningful name.\n    To avoid repeating a block of code several times.\"\n\nwhere it is said that it is not allowed to have a (e)ret instruction.\n\nThis change matches the similar TF-A code (except that there is no write macro) and commit message clearly states that. This macro can be used not only in amy_helper.S but in any other driver which needs the same sort of calling method (blr x, br x).\n\nYou wrote:\n\"Would you consider func read reg:req instead?\"\n\nLook at\nhttps://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/tf-a-tests.git/tree/include/common/asm_macros_common.S#n17\n\nAre you aware that \"func\" is a macro itself?\n.macro func _name\n\nand would you explain how \"func\" can get system register as a parameter to use in \"mrs\" instruction?",
