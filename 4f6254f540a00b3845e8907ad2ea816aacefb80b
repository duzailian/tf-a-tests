      "message": "I think this bug was introduced because there is a misalignment between PLAT_MAX_SPI_OFFSET_ID being an offset from IRQ #32 and MAX_PPI_ID being the actual interrupt number, not an offset. This creates confusion. We should look into using offsets in both cases, or absolute values in both cases.",
