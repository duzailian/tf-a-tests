This seems to be a repeating comment which I am giving for your patches and it is taking a lot of effort from my part.\n\nexample:\n\" Find an IPA which is mapped at Level 0 of Stage 2 tables in RMM with HIPAS\u003dx and RIPAS \u003d y \"\n\nWhy is PAGE_POOL_BASE selected here ? Previously we have selected TFTF_BASE. It is not reader friendly to select random symbols in Linker script which may have certain property on FVP. Would rather we stick to one symbol and iterate till we find a match.\n\nIt seems HIPAS\u003dUNASSIGNED and RIPAS_EMPTY being selected. This again needs to be mentioned in test description.",
