      "message": "You are right. there is no explicit check in this test that the second SP got preempted by a non secure interrupt. However, the functionality around an SP getting preempted by a NS interrupt(i.e. action is signaled) is independently tested in another test case test_ffa_ns_interrupt_signaled() in line 182.\n\nI felt it was sufficient for testing purposes. However, if you insist, I can enhance the cactus_fwd_sleep_cmd() to take an additional argument that hints that the final SP is expected to be preempted. Let me know your opinion.",
