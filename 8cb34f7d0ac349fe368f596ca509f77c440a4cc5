      "message": "I think this test should also check that the secondary cpu was effectively never turned on by RMM.\n\nWhat if, in addition to check the ret value, you set is_secondary_cpu_booted to \u00270\u0027 before calling realm_cpu_on() (or get a copy of it for later), wait for some time and then verify that is_secondary_cpu_booted has not been altered and that psci_affinity_info() for the secondary CPU returns PSCI_STATE_OFF? I think that would give reassurance that RMM never woke the secondary CPU up.",
