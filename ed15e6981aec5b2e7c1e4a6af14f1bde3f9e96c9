      "message": "Changed the behavior to skip tests if the STD SMC is not supported.\nThis also means that we skip the `smc32_fast` test too, where the next test fixes the PSCI version issue.\nWe can either abandon the next patch or not skip the rest of the test case in `smc32_fast`. TBH it would be a bit misleading to continue the test, because then we cannot distinguish between \u0027Success with STD SMC support\u0027 or \u0027Success without STD SMC support\u0027 result.",
