      "message": "I am running this test on Juno board since it is a real platform and has GICv2. On a side note, this test still fails on Juno board with the error message shown on lines 105-111. This barrier (line 69) is helping to at least get a clean fail rather than a test hang. The test always hangs on FVP , even with this change, but I am suspecting it could be a bug in FVP model related to modeling of spurious interrupts with GICv2.",
