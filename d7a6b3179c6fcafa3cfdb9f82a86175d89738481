      "message": "I think it does not really make a difference here. The EL3 payload code is so small. There\u0027s only a couple of header files, all contained within the el3_payload/ sub-directory. Also the code doesn\u0027t depend on the libc (or any other library for that matter). In this context, I don\u0027t even picture what would be a system header file and a local one.\n\nBesides, all other platform.S files in the EL3 payload use local header files at the moment so I think Chandni just aligned with what already exists.",
