      "message": "this method of handling interrupt is confusing (at least at the moment, so bear with me). Can we do this without consuming the FFA_INTERRUPT in the interrupt handler? The interrupt handler remains simple in that it always calls spm_interrupt_get and the interrupt handler.\nThe FFA_INTERRUPT can always be consumed in the main wait loop. In the wait loop, you know if the interrupts are enabled or disabled so if you see an FFA_INTERRUPT, you simply go back to FFA_MSG_WAIT in the wait loop, which will signal completion of the interrupt...\n\nAlso i dont understand the ffa_run in handle_interrupt. If we follow the above design, can we get rid of the ffa_run? \nI feel like above design is simpler and cleaner as the example to follow..unless i\u0027m missing something..",
