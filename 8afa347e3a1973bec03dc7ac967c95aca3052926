      "message": "I might have missed the rationale for this patch...\n\nAs far as I understand, the only piece of platform-specific information here is the base address of the timer frame.  And as a matter of fact, SYS_CNT_BASE1 is a platform macro at the moment (and for that reason it should probably be renamed into PLAT_SYS_CNT_BASE or similar).\n\nApart from that, this piece of code just reads the Generic Timer memory-mapped registers, which are architecturally defined (see section I2.3 in the Arm Arm, rev D.a) so this does not look specific to Arm platforms to me.\n\nCould you please explain what was the exact problem you faced?",

      "message": "The Arm ARM indeed says that the *memory-mapped timers* are optional but the *memory-mapped counter module* is required and as far as I understand, that\u0027s all we need to measure time here.\n\nIt seems to me that we could simply read the CNTCV (Counter Count Value) memory-mapped register to implement this function in a generic manner. Alternatively we could use the system register interface (MSR/MRS) and read the CNTPCT_EL0 (Counter-timer Physical Count) register, which I think is equivalent (TBC).\n\nThen I think we should move this function to the drivers/ layer.\n\nThe system *timer* is another matter and as John pointed out, some platforms might use a timer IP that does not expose a Generic Timer interface, like Juno (which uses SP804) or Hikey960 as it seems. But as far as I can see, platform ports can already override the system timer callbacks through the plat_initialise_timer_ops() function so I think we\u0027re good on this front.",
