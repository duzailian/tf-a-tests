      "message": "The fact that CPTR_EL2 resets to an architecturally unknown value means we should not use a read/update/write pattern here. Otherwise, we\u0027re just setting the TFP and TZ bits to known values but the rest of the register remains to whatever value the hardware resets to.\n\nInstead, we should directly program the value we want (just like HCR_EL2 above).",

      "message": "It\u0027s better to use tftf_testcase_printf() for this kind of messages. INFO() messages are printed as the test goes on so it can be easily missed out in the flow of other UART output messages if the log level is high. As such, it\u0027s better suited for debugging information.\n\nOn the other hand, tftf_testcase_printf() stores the message into the test report so it gets displayed at the end of test session. Both the test status (skipped) and the reason why it was skipped are then displayed at the same place.\n\n(Note that then you can get rid of the function naming printing here, as well as the \"skipped because\" part, because the message will be printed just below the test result and test name so this would become redundant information).",
